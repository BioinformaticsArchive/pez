Pez: Phylogenetics for the Environmental Sciences
\section*{Short Structured Abstract}
\subsection*{Summary}
Pez is an \emph{R} package that calculates 30 community phylogenetic
metrics, statistically models phylogenetic, trait, and community data,
and simulates eco-phylogenetic data. It provides a common programmatic
standard for the management and manipulation of eco-phylogenetic data
in \emph{R}.
\subsection*{Availability}
Pez is released under the GPL v3 open-source license, available on the
Internet from CRAN (\url{http://cran.r-project.org}). The package is
under active development, and the authors welcome contributions (see
\url{http://github.com/willpearse/pez}).

\section*{Text}
\subsection*{Introduction}
Community phylogenetics intends to link observed ecological structure
with the evolutionary processes that generate species
\autocite[see][]{Webb2002,Cavender-Bares2009}. This growing field has
generated a large number of software packages
\autocite[notably][]{Webb2008,Regetz2009,Kembel2010,Orme2013,Eastman2013},
each with remarkably different designs and implementation details that
can make routine analysis challenging. Many more metrics have code
available only as supplementary materials to papers which are not
maintained, or have no publically available source code. With no one
to maintain this code, these valuable metrics are effectively lost to
the scientific community.

\emph{Pez} provides an \emph{R} class (\emph{comparative.comm}) that
links phylogenetic, community composition, and environmental data in a
single data structure. It provides wrappers for metrics (many
previously unavailable in \emph{R}), thematically organising them
according to the \textcite{Pearse2014review} framework. It also
implements and extends the regression framework presented
by \parencite{Cavender-Bares2004} \autocite[see
also][]{Cavender-Bares2006}, and provides code to simulate null
data. Our hope is that will speed the analysis of eco-phylogenetic
datasets, and provide a common \emph{R} framework for the phylogenetic
analysis of environmental data.
\subsection*{Description}
\subsubsection*{Data manipulation and storage}
\emph{Pez} extends the data manipulation and import/export features of
\emph{R}, and contains a unified class to contain all eco-phyogenetic
data. It simplifyies the process of ensuring community ecological,
environmental, and phylogenetic data are compatible by overloading
\emph{R}'s standard row and column operators. This makes it simple to
make consistent changes across datasets; for example, removing a
species from the community data automatically trims it from the
phylogeny, and removes its associated trait data. \emph{Pez} was
designed to be backwards-compatible with \emph{caper}'s
\autocite{Orme2013} \emph{comparative.data} class, permitting detailed
comparative analysis of species trait data without additional fuss.
\subsubsection*{Metrics}
Following the classification of \textcite{Pearse2014review},
\emph{pez} simplifies the calculation and comparison of a number of
metrics by grouping them into four categories: \emph{shape},
\emph{evenness}, \emph{dispersion}, and \emph{dissimilarity}. Briefly,
shape metrics examine the structure of an assemblage phylogeny, while
evenness metrics incorporate speciesâ€™ abundances. Dispersion metrics
examine assemblages given a phylogeny of species that could occupy
that assemblage (the source pool), while dissimilarity metrics compare
phylogenetic structure between assemblages. Table \ref{metricTable}
gives an overview of the functions contained within \emph{pez},
including the metrics it can calculate. Additionally, \emph{trait.asm}
permits the direct comparison of phylogenetic and trait structure,
following the \emph{traitgram} framework of XXX. Speeding and easing
the comparison of community phylogenetic metrics is important, since
each can reveal radically different aspects of the structure of
ecological assemblages \autocite{Cadotte2010}.

\subsubsection*{Models}
Model-based approaches are, in many ways, an advance over metrics that
simply quantify phylogenetic pattern in ecological assemblages. Models
explain phylogenetic structure across a number of assemblages
simultaneously, maximising statistical power, and can incorporate
phylogenetic, environmental, trait, and other information. \emph{Pez}
contains a complete re-implentation of all routines previously
available in \emph{EcoPhyl} (XXX) that regress species co-existence
matrices against environmental and, trait, and phylogenetic distance
matrices \autocite{Cavender-Bares2004,Cavender-Bares2006}. It extends
these routines to include, for example, more modern measures of
phylogenetic signal (\emph{e.g.}, $\lambda$, $delta$, $\kappa$, $D$),
and to examine differences in relationships among clades.
\subsection*{Simulation}
Finally, \emph{pez} contains a number of functions that will simulate
ecological communities under various null models of community assembly
and/or evolution. \emph{scape} is intended to model community assembly
over a region, and models both species niche width and
range. \emph{metapop.sim} fits models of trait evolution and dispersal
ability to a static landscape, evolving both a phylogeny, species
traits, and the resulting distribution of species across the
landscape. While these are works in progress, we are confident that
they at least form a basis for further model-based exploration of
data.
